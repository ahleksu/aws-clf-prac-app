In a rehosting strategy, also known as \"lift and shift\", the company can move its existing CMS application to the AWS Cloud without making any modifications to the application itself. This means that the application will run in the cloud environment as-is, without needing to be rearchitected or redeveloped. Rehosting is a relatively straightforward migration approach that minimizes the need for extensive changes to the application code, configuration, or architecture. This makes it an efficient and low-effort way for the company to migrate its CMS application to the cloud. Therefore, in this scenario, rehosting would be the recommended migration strategy as it allows for a quick and easy migration of the incompatible CMS application to the AWS Cloud."

        "status": "correct",
        "explanation": "Elimination of expenses for running and maintaining data centers is considered an advantage when users move on-premises workloads to the AWS Cloud because it helps reduce operational costs. By leveraging AWS's infrastructure and services, companies can eliminate the need to invest in and manage their own physical data centers, which can be expensive and resource-intensive. AWS takes care of the maintenance, security, and scalability of the infrastructure, allowing users to focus on their core business activities rather than on managing hardware and facilities. This shift to a more cost-effective and efficient cloud-based model can lead to significant cost savings for organizations."

        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Elimination of operational expenses is actually a valid advantage that users experience when they move on-premises workloads to the AWS Cloud. By moving workloads to the cloud, organizations can reduce or eliminate costs associated with maintaining on-premises hardware, such as hardware maintenance, electricity, cooling, and physical security. Additionally, the cloud provider takes care of many operational tasks, which can further reduce the operational burden on IT teams. Therefore, elimination of operational expenses is an incorrect answer because it's not accurate to say that all operational expenses are eliminated. Users are still responsible for managing and optimizing their cloud resources, applications, and configurations."

        "text": "Culture evolution",
        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Culture evolution is not the correct answer for an AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) business perspective capability because culture evolution is actually one of the five perspectives of the AWS CAF, not a capability within a perspective. The five perspectives in the AWS CAF are business, people, governance, platform, and security. Within each perspective, there are capabilities that help organizations align their strategies with business objectives and build the necessary skills and competencies to achieve their cloud adoption goals. Therefore, when considering an AWS CAF business perspective capability, you should focus on specific capabilities within the business perspective, such as business innovation, organizational change management, or defining the business case for cloud adoption."

        "text": "Platform architecture",
        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Platform architecture is not an AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) business perspective capability because it falls under the technical perspective capability. Platform architecture is related to designing the technical architecture of the IT infrastructure that supports the business requirements, such as the selection of the right services, deployment models, and technologies to build a scalable and secure platform. In contrast, in the AWS CAF business perspective capabilities focus on aligning the overall business goals, strategy, and processes with the adoption of cloud technology. These capabilities include areas such as defining business requirements, creating a business case, identifying risks and opportunities, establishing governance, defining roles and responsibilities, and planning for organizational change management."

        "explanation": "Event management is not typically considered a capability within the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) business perspective. The AWS CAF business perspective focuses on capabilities related to business management, such as defining a business case, developing a cloud adoption plan, creating a business roadmap, establishing governance, and others. Event management, on the other hand, is related to monitoring and responding to events or incidents within an IT environment, which falls more under operational aspects of cloud management rather than the business perspective of cloud adoption."

        "text": "Scalability",
        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads by adding resources without impacting performance. While scalability is an important AWS Cloud benefit, it is not directly related to the ability of an architecture to withstand failures with minimal downtime."

        "text": "Elasticity",
        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Elasticity is not the correct answer because elasticity refers to the ability of an architecture to automatically adjust capacity based on demand. While elasticity is indeed a key benefit of the AWS Cloud, the ability to withstand failures with minimal downtime is better represented by the concept of High Availability."

        "text": "Agility",
        "status": "skipped",
        "explanation": "Agility is not the correct answer in this context because agility refers to the ability to quickly adapt and respond to changes in the environment or business needs. While agility is an important benefit of cloud computing, the specific benefit being highlighted in this question is the architecture's ability to withstand failures with minimal downtime. This benefit relates more closely to the concept of fault tolerance and high availability, where the architecture is designed to continue functioning even if individual components fail, thus minimizing any impact on the overall system's availability and performance."
      },
      {
        "text": "High availability",
        "status": "correct",
        "explanation": "High availability specifically ensures continuous service in the face of failures by implementing redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms. Therefore, an architecture able to withstand failures with minimal downtime demonstrates high availability as its primary benefit."
